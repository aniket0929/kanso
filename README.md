# Kanso — Clinical Operations Platform

Kanso is a modern, full-stack clinical operations platform that helps healthcare practices and service-based businesses manage bookings, patient intake, communication, and resource tracking — all from a single, beautiful dashboard.

Built with a "Zen" design philosophy: minimal friction, maximum clarity.

## What It Does

Kanso automates the operational overhead of running a practice. A business owner signs up, configures their services, and gets a public-facing booking page. When a customer books an appointment, Kanso automatically:

1. **Confirms the booking** and sends a confirmation email to the customer.
2. **Notifies the business owner** via email with all the appointment details.
3. **Sends an intake form link** so the customer can fill out pre-visit information.
4. **Logs everything** in a shared inbox for the team to review.

No manual follow-ups. No missed leads.

## How It Works — The Flow

### Customer Journey
```
Customer visits public booking page →
  Selects service, date & time →
    Submits booking with contact info →
      ✅ Booking created in database
      📧 Confirmation email sent to customer (via Gmail SMTP)
      📧 Notification email sent to business owner
      📧 Intake form link sent to customer
      📱 SMS confirmation sent (if Twilio configured)
```

### Contact Form Flow
```
Customer submits contact form →
  Contact record created →
    Message logged in shared inbox →
      📧 "We received your message" email sent to customer
```

### Business Owner Journey
```
Sign up via Clerk →
  Complete onboarding wizard (8 steps) →
    Configure services, forms, inventory →
      Share public booking link →
        Manage everything from the dashboard
```
